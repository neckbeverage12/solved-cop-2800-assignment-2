This week we are going to write a program that calculates wages for three employees.  The screen shot is a sample run showing how your program should work.

 </noscript>Examine the input and output for employee 2 above.  Employees that work more than 40 hours are paid ‘time and a half’, i.e. 1.5 times their normal rate, for hours above 40.




You do not have to input employee names, just call them 1, 2, and 3.  However, the majority of your program should be done in a <strong>loop</strong>, i.e. there should be only one statement that prompts for hourly rate, etc.
